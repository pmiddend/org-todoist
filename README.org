* org-todoist

[[https://travis-ci.com/pmiddend/org-todoist.svg?branch=master][https://travis-ci.com/pmiddend/org-todoist.svg?branch=master]]

Converts Todoist to an org-mode file. Projects will be top-level items, then items.

** Usage

It’s a Python program using setuptools, to building/installation/… should be done through =setup.py=. Alternatively, just use [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]]: =git clone … && nix-build=, then =result/bin/org-todoist=.

You need to create an [[https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/][API token]] for this to work and that needs to be either stored inside an environment variable =TODOIST_TOKEN= or inside =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/org-todoist/=.

Then call the program, without any arguments. It will write the org-file to stdout, so you can redirect it.

To call this from emacs, one ugly way would be:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key
 (kbd "s-<f5>")
 (lambda
   ()
   (interactive)
   (progn
     (message "Updating via todoist...")
     (call-process-shell-command "/path/to/todoist/org-todoist > /tmp/todoist.org")
     (message "Done!")
     )
   )
 )
#+end_src

For this to work, you need to adapt the path to todoist and add =/tmp/todoist.org= to =org-agenda-files=, of course.
